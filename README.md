In this game, you face off against a demon lord named PhayaYom. To defeat it, you create a character by specifying weapons and abilities through prompts. You can choose to be a swordsman, mage, Jedi, dragon tamer, or even your favorite character—the possibilities are limitless, constrained only by your imagination.

Your goal is to expose the demon's weakness and defeat it with the right prompt. Since battle outcomes are determined by a large language model (Claude 3 Sonnet), the game challenges players to use their creativity in battle. With multiple ways to complete the game, each playthrough offers a unique and engaging experience.

I’ve carefully engineered PhayaYom with specific strengths and weaknesses. Try using prompt engineering to reveal and exploit them!
